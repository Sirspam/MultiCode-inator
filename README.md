Beat Saber mod that adds a !multicode command to your stream which posts the current multiplayer lobby code into your chat
## Usage
After installation the commands **!multicode** and **!mc** will be added to your twitch chat. When one of these are posted, in your Twitch chat, the code for your current multiplayer lobby will be posted

There is a toggle in the multiplayer setup panel which can be used to enable and disable the command.
## Installation
Download the latest version of MultiCode-inator from [releases](https://github.com/Sirspam/MultiCode-inator/releases) and slap it into your BeatSaber's plugin folder.
