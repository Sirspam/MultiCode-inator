## Usage
After installation the commands **!mc** and **!multicode** will be added to your twitch chat. When one of these are posted, in your Twitch chat, the code for your current multiplayer lobby will be posted

There is a toggle in the multiplayer setup panel which can be used to enable and disable the command.
