## Usage
### On Screen Text
The on screen text will appear whenever in a multiplayer lobby or game. Settings such as the text's size, colour, position and content can all be set from MultiCode-inator's settings.

Note: When setting the text use "{code}" to represent where the multiplayer lobby code should be on the text.
### Stream Command
After installation the commands **!multicode** and **!mc** will be added to your stream chat. When one of these commands are used in your stream chat, the code for your current multiplayer lobby will be posted.

MultiCode-inator can also post the current lobby code into your stream chat whenever you join a new multiplayer lobby.

MultiCode-inator's settings are accessible from a button to the right of the server code in the multiplayer setup panel.
